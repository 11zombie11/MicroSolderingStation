##Description

Remove the pcb from the soldering iron and grab a cable with 4 wires (2 for thermistor, 2 for the heater).
Poke an hole in the side of the iron's case, near the yellow nut, to pass the 2 wires and solder them to the thermistor.
Use kapton tape to isolate the thermistor pins and to fix the thermistor's glass tip to the iron end with some kapton turns.
The other 2 wires connect to the heater and the led with a resistor in series. (watch the polarity of the led)
Remove the ball bearing anc connect the led in the hole, break the spring post from the other side of the case.
